      <h2>Childhood Years</h2>
      <p>
        My name is <strong>Bryan D. Esico</strong>, and I am currently a student at <abbr title="University of the East">UE</abbr>, where I am pursuing my studies in <em>CS - Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (B.S.C.S.)</em>. I was born on <strong>08/18/2005</strong> in a small city called <u>Sorsogon City</u>. My childhood passed gently, without many burdens, and I have grown up with a strong interest in <b>technology</b>.

      <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
      <p>
        Little about my teenage years do I remember, since many moments have disappeared like the morning mist above quiet fields. In that indistinct period of time, however, something in me gradually began to take shape. I paid attention to what would make my heart tingle with glee, no matter how small or transient that feeling was.
      </p>
      <p>
        Handling schoolwork alongside hobbies proved more difficult than I had wished for. Gaming was the main call when excitement and even a means of escapism were needed. Anime nurtured my imagination with colorful worlds and characters I looked up to. Technology fascinated me because it was a field with infinite possibilities and mysteries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, every day taught me something I had not known before. I learned responsibility grows not suddenly but in bits. Mistakes were not failures but lessons in disguise, and through them, my confidence slowly grew.

      <h2>College Years</h2>
      <p style="font-style: italic;">
        My college life marked a new chapter filled with challenges and discoveries that I had never faced before. Each day felt like a fresh test of what I could handle and how much I was willing to grow. The study of computer science pushed me beyond my comfort zone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Time management, creativity, teamwork, and perseverance became essential. Late nights studying revealed the strength of determination and helped me understand the future I wanted to build.
      </p>
      <p>
        College taught me responsibility and confidence. It showed me that even the tiniest progress is worth celebrating, guiding me toward the person I am becoming.
